 ### Random Number Generator
 I used the master file heavily but tried to make changes where I could. At the start of this assignment, the code looked insane. Now that I have looked at 
 it for a while, it is starting to make sense. I still would not have even come close without the master. 
 ### Warning 
 My random number generator seems to not be generating things correctly. It uses the same numbers a lot and I don't know why.
